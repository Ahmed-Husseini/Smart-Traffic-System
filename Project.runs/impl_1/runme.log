WARNING: [DRC 23-20] Rule violation (PDRC-153) Gated clock check - Net Ultrasonic_Sensor/Alarm_reg_i_2_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin Ultrasonic_Sensor/Alarm_reg_i_2/O, cell Ultrasonic_Sensor/Alarm_reg_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
WARNING: [DRC 23-20] Rule violation (RPBF-3) IO port buffering is incomplete - Device port Data_Line expects both input and output buffering but the buffers are incomplete.
